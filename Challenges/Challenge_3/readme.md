Apply your knowledge of physics, scrolling backgrounds, and special effects to a balloon floating through town, picking up tokens while avoiding explosives. You will have to do a lot of troubleshooting in this project because it is riddled with errors.

Challenge Outcome:
* The balloon floats upwards as the player holds spacebar
* The background seamlessly repeats, simulating the balloon’s movement
* Bombs and Money tokens are spawned randomly on a timer 
* When you collide with the Money, there’s a particle and sound effect
* When you collide with the Bomb, there’s an explosion and the background stops
