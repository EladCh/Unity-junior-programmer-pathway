Project Outcome:

* The character, background, and obstacle of your choice will be set up. The player will be able to press spacebar and make the character jump, as obstacles spawn at the edge of the screen and block the playerâ€™s path
* The background moves flawlessly at the same time as the obstacles, and the obstacles will despawn when they exit game boundaries. With the power of script communication, the background and spawn manager will halt when the player collides with an obstacle. Colliding with an obstacle will also trigger a game over message in the console log, halting the background and the spawn manager.
* With the animations from the animator controller, the character will have 3 new animations that occur in 3 different game states. These states include running, jumping, and death, all of which transition smoothly and are timed to suit the game.
* Music will play as the player runs through the scene, kicking up dirt particles in a spray behind their feet. A springy sound will play as they jump and a boom will play as they crash, bursting in a cloud of smoke particles as they fall over.
