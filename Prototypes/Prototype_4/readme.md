Project Outcome:
* The camera will evenly rotate around a focal point in the center of the island, provided a horizontal input from the player. The player will control a textured sphere, and move them forwards or backwards in the direction of the aforementioned focal point.
* A textured and spherical enemy will spawn on the island at start, in a random location determined by a custom function. It will chase the player around the island, bouncing them off the edge if they get too close. 
* A powerup will spawn in a random position on the map, eagerly awaiting the player. Once the player collides with this powerup, the powerup will disappear and the player will be highlighted by an indicator. The powerup will last for 5 seconds after pickup, granting the player super strength that blasts away enemies!
* The Spawn Manager will operate in waves, spawning multiple enemies and a new powerup with each iteration. Every time the enemies drop to zero, a new wave is spawned and the enemy count increases.
