Project Outcome:

* The player will be able to move left and right on the screen based on the user’s left and right key presses, but will not be able to leave the play area on either side.
* The player will be able to press the Spacebar and launch a projectile prefab into the scene, which destroys itself when it leaves the game’s boundaries. The animals will also be removed from the scene when they leave the game boundaries.
* When the user presses the S key, a randomly selected animal will spawn at a random position at the top of the screen, walking towards the player.
* The animals will spawn on a timed interval and walk down the screen, triggering a “Game Over” message if they make it past the player. If the player hits them with a projectile to feed them, they will be destroyed.
