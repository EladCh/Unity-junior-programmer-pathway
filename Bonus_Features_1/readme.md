In [this](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/bonus-features-1-share-your-work#) tutorial, you can go way above and beyond what you learned in this Unit and share what youâ€™ve made with your fellow creators. 
There are four bonus features presented in this tutorial marked as Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert. You can attempt any number of these, put your own spin on them, and then share your work!
This tutorial is entirely optional, but highly recommended for anyone wishing to take their skills to a new level.

to see the implementation of each difficulty level please see the commits of https://github.com/EladCh/Unity-Create-with-Code/pull/3
